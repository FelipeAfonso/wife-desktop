"""Stop hook: refuse to end a turn whose reply skipped the unslop skill.

Scans the transcript for a Skill tool call with skill == "unslop" after the
last real user prompt. If none is found and the turn produced a non-trivial
amount of assistant text, emit a block decision so the model invokes the
skill and rewrites before the reply ships.

Fail-open by design: any parse problem, a missing transcript, or a missing
skill directory lets the turn end normally. stop_hook_active guards against
a block loop, so a turn is bounced at most once.
